                            movement that was created in the late
                            nineteenth century with a unique idea for education by lectures(talks). The first actual
                            lecture took place on the lake Chautauqua,
                            from where the name comes.

                            floods us with information about everything,
                            but not always with one that brings us satisfaction makes us more knowledgeable, aware or
                            inspired. We like the idea making a place,
                            where people can search for pure inspiration and
                            be a part of that, by creating their own story. So here we are now!

                            accurate stories with pictures.
                            To create your story you should have a storyline consisting of 4 photos which are directly
                            connected to your story ,
                            Each photo should hold that part of your story that you consider most accurate for.
                            The final result should be a story of real inspiration with photos that makes the whole
                            experience stronger.
                            It is important that all the photo are being made by the user himself.
